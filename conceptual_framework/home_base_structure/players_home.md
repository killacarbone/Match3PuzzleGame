# Player's Home

## Main Interface
The player's home serves as the central hub of the game, functioning as the primary interface where players can access various game features and activities.

## Customization
Players can customize their home by:
- **Designing Rooms:** Each room in the house, such as the living room, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, can be designed and customized with different furniture, decor items, and color schemes.
- **Furniture and Decor:** A wide range of furniture and decor items can be purchased or unlocked through gameplay. Players can arrange and rearrange these items to create their unique home designs.
- **Room Upgrades:** Players start with basic rooms and can upgrade them to more luxurious versions, unlocking additional customization options and increasing the aesthetic appeal of their home.

## Housework and Puzzle Integration
- **Housework Tasks:** Players can perform various housework tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, and organizing, which are integrated into the Match-3 puzzle gameplay. Completing these tasks through puzzles rewards players with items, coins, or special tools for further customization.
- **Progression System:** As players complete tasks and puzzles, they progress through different levels, unlocking new rooms and customization options.

## Inspiration and References
- **Animal Crossing: New Horizons:** The home customization and progression concept is inspired by the mechanics in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players start with a basic home and gradually expand and decorate it.
