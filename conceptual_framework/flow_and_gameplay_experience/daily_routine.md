# Daily Routine

## Log-In Rewards

Daily log-in rewards encourage players to return to the game. Rewards can include:
- In-game currency
- Special items
- Customization options

Implement a progression calendar where players receive increasing rewards for consecutive log-ins (e.g., 5 days in a row).

## Daily Tasks

Daily tasks keep gameplay fresh and engaging. Examples of daily tasks include:
- Cleaning specific rooms
- Arranging furniture
- Gardening activities

Daily tasks should provide buffs, such as extra rewards, without penalizing players who miss a day. This approach balances engagement with player satisfaction.

### Notification Reminders

Sending notifications to remind players to log in can help maintain engagement. Notifications can highlight:
- Log-in rewards
- New daily tasks
- Upcoming events

## Balancing Daily Tasks

Ensure daily tasks are enjoyable and not burdensome. They should offer:
- Variety in activities
- Opportunities for quick completion
- Optional pay-for-convenience features
