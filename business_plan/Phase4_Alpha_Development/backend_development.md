Develop the monetization infrastructure to support in-app purchases and integrate advertisements in a non-intrusive manner.

### Key Steps:

1. **In-App Purchases (IAP):**

   - Ensure compliance with platform-specific guidelines (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store).
   - **Reference:** [Implementing In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/)

2. **Ad Integration:**
   - Integrate rewarded ads that offer in-game rewards for watching advertisements.
   - Use ad mediation platforms to optimize ad revenue and manage multiple ad networks.

3. **Monetization Strategy:**
   - Develop a balanced monetization strategy that combines IAP and ads without disrupting the player experience.
   - Monitor and adjust the strategy based on player feedback and analytics data.
