# Basic Prototype Development

## Implement Core Match-3 Mechanics

**Objective:**
Develop the foundational gameplay mechanics for the Match-3 puzzle game, ensuring a smooth and engaging player experience.

### Key Steps:

1. **Tile Matching Logic:**
   - Implement the core logic for matching three or more tiles of the same type.
   - Ensure that matches trigger appropriate actions, such as clearing tiles and generating new ones.

2. **Special Tile Creation:**
   - Develop mechanics for creating special tiles through specific match patterns (e.g., striped tiles, wrapped tiles, color bombs).
   - Define the behaviors and effects of each special tile.

3. **Power-Ups and Boosters:**
   - Implement basic power-ups and boosters, such as extra moves, shuffle, and hammers.
   - Define how these power-ups can be obtained and used during gameplay.

4. **Grid and Tile Management:**
   - Create a dynamic grid system that handles tile placement, movement, and replacement.
   - Ensure smooth animations and transitions for tile movements.

### Develop Initial Levels and Basic Customization Features

**Objective:**
Create a set of initial levels to test core mechanics and introduce basic customization features to enhance player engagement.

### Key Steps:

1. **Level Design:**
   - Design and implement a series of introductory levels to showcase core gameplay mechanics.
   - Gradually increase difficulty and introduce new challenges and obstacles.

2. **Customization Features:**
   - Implement basic customization options for home and garden environments.
   - Allow players to unlock and apply different styles, colors, and items.

3. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Develop an intuitive and accessible UI for level selection, customization, and gameplay.
   - Ensure the UI aligns with the overall visual style and theme.
